	- Quarto developers doesn't seem interested in implementing code-wrapping for PDF format,
	it seems like it's a way bigger issue regarding file rendering, and no current (07-10-2024)
	seems to produce a satisfactory result.

	- Font size for code chunks can either be modified by changing all monofont sizes from the 
	YAML like 'monofontoptions:\n  - Scale=0.55', or locally for each chunk by putting before 
	the cell (```{r}) '\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\<fontsize>}'.

	- Since quarto uses pandoc, and pandoc 'longtables' have issues with 'two column' format,
	then when using \twocolumn, evary table created with 'kable' in R, will not display.
	'kbl(df, longtable=FALSE)' must be used.

	- Need to check out 'kable' documentation, seems fairly accessible, instructive and readable
	https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_pdf.pdf
